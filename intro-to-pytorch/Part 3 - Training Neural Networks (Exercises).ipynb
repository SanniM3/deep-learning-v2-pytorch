Neural networks with non-linear activations work like universal function approximators. There is some function that maps your input to the output.

Through the `nn` module, PyTorch provides losses such as the cross-entropy loss (`nn.CrossEntropyLoss`). You'll usually see the loss assigned to `criterion`. As noted in the last part, with a classification problem such as MNIST, we're using the softmax function to predict class probabilities. With a softmax output, you want to use cross-entropy as the loss. To actually calculate the loss, you first define the criterion then pass in the output of your network and the correct labels.\n","\n","Something really important to note here.

This raw output is usually called the *logits* or *scores*. We use the logits because softmax gives you probabilities which will often be very close to zero or one but floating-point numbers can't accurately represent values near zero or one ([read more here](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/floatingpoint.html)).

The general process with PyTorch:\n","\n","* Make a forward pass through the network \n","* Use the network output to calculate the loss\n","* Perform a backward pass through the network with `loss.backward()` to calculate the gradients\n","* Take a step with the optimizer to update the weights\n","\n","Below I'll go through one training step and print out the weights and gradients so you can see how it changes. Note that I have a line of code `optimizer.zero_grad()`. When you do multiple backwards passes with the same parameters, the gradients are accumulated. This means that you need to zero the gradients on each training pass or you'll retain gradients from previous training batches."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"-13qugIjWtMG","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":289},"outputId":"7f76464e-6369-4d5d-b933-d94cd40981c8","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1580337419912,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":1364,"user":{"displayName":"mide","photoUrl":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-j7Ycj-VA_Rw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAABBI/1SRWE1EhGPc/s64/photo.jpg","userId":"02752775194580783039"}}},"source":["print('Initial weights - ', model[0].weight)\n","\n","images, labels = next(iter(trainloader))\n","images.resize_(64, 784)\n","\n","# Clear the gradients, do this because gradients are accumulated\n","optimizer.zero_grad()\n","\n","# Forward pass, then backward pass, then update weights\n","output = model(images)\n","loss = criterion(output, labels)\n","loss.backward()\n","print('Gradient -', model[0].weight.grad)"],"execution_count":14,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["Initial weights -  Parameter containing:\n","tensor([[ 0.0253, -0.0138, -0.0024,  ..., -0.0082, -0.0263, -0.0311],\n","        [-0.0039, -0.0274, -0.0310,  ...,  0.0239,  0.0242, -0.0067],\n","        [-0.0078,  0.0227,  0.0079,  ...,  0.0019,  0.0199, -0.0260],\n","        ...,\n","        [ 0.0083, -0.0185,  0.0202,  ...,  0.0193,  0.0144, -0.0099],\n","        [-0.0280, -0.0206, -0.0034,  ...,  0.0294,  0.0317,  0.0080],\n","        [ 0.0096,  0.0219,  0.0334,  ..., -0.0073,  0.0094, -0.0070]],\n","       requires_grad=True)\n","Gradient - tensor([[ 0.0036,  0.0036,  0.0036,  ...,  0.0036,  0.0036,  0.0036],\n","        [-0.0021, -0.0021, -0.0021,  ..., -0.0021, -0.0021, -0.0021],\n","        [ 0.0037,  0.0037,  0.0037,  ...,  0.0037,  0.0037,  0.0037],\n","        ...,\n","        [ 0.0027,  0.0027,  0.0027,  ...,  0.0027,  0.0027,  0.0027],\n","        [-0.0008, -0.0008, -0.0008,  ..., -0.0008, -0.0008, -0.0008],\n","        [-0.0007, -0.0007, -0.0007,  ..., -0.0007, -0.0007, -0.0007]])\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"dQYyRJKJWtMK","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":170},"outputId":"fa80ca69-7c7d-42b7-870c-b4d2dbf8d557","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1580337454493,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":1105,"user":{"displayName":"mide","photoUrl":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-j7Ycj-VA_Rw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAABBI/1SRWE1EhGPc/s64/photo.jpg","userId":"02752775194580783039"}}},"source":["# Take an update step and few the new weights\n","optimizer.step()\n","print('Updated weights - ', model[0].weight)"],"execution_count":15,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["Updated weights -  Parameter containing:\n","tensor([[ 0.0253, -0.0139, -0.0024,  ..., -0.0082, -0.0263, -0.0311],\n","        [-0.0038, -0.0274, -0.0310,  ...,  0.0240,  0.0242, -0.0067],\n","        [-0.0078,  0.0227,  0.0079,  ...,  0.0019,  0.0199, -0.0261],\n","        ...,\n","        [ 0.0083, -0.0185,  0.0202,  ...,  0.0193,  0.0144, -0.0099],\n","        [-0.0280, -0.0206, -0.0034,  ...,  0.0294,  0.0317,  0.0080],\n","        [ 0.0096,  0.0219,  0.0334,  ..., -0.0073,  0.0094, -0.0070]],\n","       requires_grad=True)\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"GvwUwk57WtMO","colab_type":"text"},"source":["### Training for real\n","\n","Now we'll put this algorithm into a loop so we can go through all the images.
